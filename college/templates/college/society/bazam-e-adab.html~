Bazm-e-Adab is one of the oldest societies of St.Stephen’s College. The society explores the different genres of Urdu literature which are indeed varied and also distinct from one another in degree and kind. Urdu literature has a long and colorful history that is inextricably tied to that very language. While it tends to be heavily dominated by poetry, the range of expressions achieved, especially the Ghazal and the nazm has led to its continued growth and expansion into different writing styles especially that of short stories or Afsana.

In the academic session 2008-09, it entered arenas that were previously untouched by the society. A very enlightening talk on the famous 20th century Urdu laureate Iqbal-“The poet, the philosopher”- was arranged by the society. It was a pleasure to invite Professor Abdul Haq to give a talk on this topic. It gave the audience an insight into the life of Mohammad Iqbal and also educated us about his political and social views. This talk was organized to introduce the basic ideas in Iqbal’s works, and with the general participation of the audience during the talk it was amply clear that it had been well received by the listeners.  

Also the annual Ghazal recitation competition for the Mirza Ghalib Running Trophy was also held under the auspices of St.Stephen’s College in which eight other colleges participated that included Ramjas, Hindu, Daulat ram, Mata Sundri, Sri Ram College of Commerce, Indraprastha College, Jamia Millia Islamia and St. Stephen’s College. Ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. These sentiments and emotions are empathized by all and hence every year the programme attracts a large audience and this year was no exception. The simplification of the conception of ghazals helped it to reach to the vast masses. The ‘Shama’ or lamp is indeed symbolic of the guiding light that it provides to us, its members, encouraging us in our attempts to develop  the society . It is for this reason that the programme begins with the lightening of the lamp.  The Ghazal programme is universally appreciated in the college since it has a distinctiveness of its own, tenderness and melody being its hallmarks.

This academic session we brought forth new and distinct taste in the programmes that we organized. Our attempt was to contribute to the college activities in all ways possible, at the same time bringing Urdu literature in its varied angles to the forefront. A small team of 14 members, every year we organize events that enlivens the mood and spirit of Bazm-e-Adab.
