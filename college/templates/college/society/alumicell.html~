 "Since its founding in 1881, St. Stephen’s College has produced a long line of
  distinguished alumni.  Eminent Stephanians are found in any Indian roll call 
  of politics, media, literature, scientific research, industry, entertainment, 
  sports and more.

We, In the Alumni Cell, seek to reach out, maintain and strengthen close ties
 with our Alumni. The Cell aims to organize ways in which present students can
  freely exchange ideas and experiences with Stephanians across the globe- to
   learn how this college helped mould their minds, how it shaped their futures,
    their life on campus and much more.

We organize a number of events through the year. In the previous years, we have
 had some significant speakers, such as Minister of State for Corporate and 
 Minority Affairs, Shri Salman Khurshid and Mr. Anup Kutty, chief – editor of 
 Maxim India, addressing important and relevant issues of our times and also 
 talking about their life experiences.  

We have also furthered our efforts of updating the alumni database with fresh 
contacts on a regular basis throughout the year and are inching towards our goal
 of the establishment of an online network so elaborate that it could become a 
 nerve centre for Stephanians in the future.  

 We also revived our journal  ‘The Mince’ which provides a platform for 
 Stephanians from all spheres of life to share with us their experiences, 
 emotions and the most endearing moments that encompassed their lives as 
 members of this institution.

An eagerly awaited event in the Alumni cell calendar is our annual dinner and 
we look forward to hosting it in a big way this year. With New ideas in mind
 like Alumni-debates and a convocation ceremony for students, the Alumni Cell 
 wishes to enhance and diversify its activities.

We want to widen the base of the Alumni Cell and incorporate new ideas. 
The alumni cell is an endeavour to strengthen bonds between Stephanians and 
keep the Stephanian spirit alive, vibrant and inclusive.

At the beginning of each year has all societies and cells look forward to 
innovating and improving themselves. Ours is a growing society that acts as a 
catalyst for the progress of our institution. There is a lot of room for reform, 
and the best way of bringing about change is to tap new talent. We encourage all 
junior members to join us in our endeavour! "
